# Gitonga Nyaga

## `Software Developer` ##


As a recent graduate of a web development bootcamp, I bring a fresh perspective and a passion for coding to the table. Certified in web development, I've immersed myself in the world of programming for about a year, continuously expanding my skills and knowledge.

Currently, I am engaged in an internship where I have the opportunity to apply my learning to real-world projects. One of the highlights of my internship experience is our capstone project, where my team and I are developing a Zillow clone. This project has been an incredible learning journey, allowing me to delve deeper into various aspects of web development, from frontend design to backend functionality.

I am deeply passionate about coding and find joy in solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through code. My dedication to my craft is evident in my strong work ethic and commitment to continuous improvement. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others and contribute my own unique insights.

With a solid foundation in web development, a year of coding experience, and a demonstrated ability to work hard and adapt to new challenges, I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team. I am excited about the opportunity to further develop my expertise and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.
